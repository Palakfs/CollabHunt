sðŸŒŸ CollabHunt â€“ Where Ideas Meet Teammates
Ever had a great idea or wanted to join a hackathon â€” but couldnâ€™t find the right team? Or worseâ€¦ joined one where only you showed up with commitment?
Iâ€™ve been there. Thatâ€™s exactly why I built CollabHunt.

CollabHunt is your all-in-one platform to find serious, like-minded teammates for hackathons, projects, startups â€” or anything youâ€™re building.

ðŸ”¥ What makes it different?

âœ… Real profiles with skills, experience, and past projects â€” not just a name and email.

âœ… Team requests with transparency â€” you know what someone's bringing to the table and what they're expecting from teammates.

âœ… Domain-filtered events â€” find hackathons and collab opportunities that match your interests.

âœ… No team? No problem. Discover open teams and send a request to join.

âœ… Built for clubs & communities â€” no more messy Discord groups for teaming up people when you are organizing a hackathon/event.

CollabHunt isnâ€™t just for hackathons. Whether you're looking for a co-founder, a project buddy, or someone to help ship your next big idea â€” this is the place.

ðŸ’» Tech Stack:
Frontend: React + TypeScript + Redux

Backend: Django REST Framework

Database: PostgreSQL

âœ¨ Built with the belief that great teams build great things â€” and everyone deserves a shot at finding theirs.
